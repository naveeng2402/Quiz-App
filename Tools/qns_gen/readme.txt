This folder is used to easily generate qns.json for the app 

this can be done in two methods
    * by filling data.txt (execute the qns_gen.py with False and {qns size} as command line arguments)
    * by using jsonnet    (execute the qns_gen.py and edit the jsonnet file and convert it to json either by jsonnet convertor or json_gen.py[requires the python module jsonnet to execute json_gen.py])

The use of this folder is not fully documented. For complete info go through the code
